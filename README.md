# Welcome to the yolo_model repository!

This package is for creating, training, and applying a convolutional neural network defined using the yolo model framework (CITE). The outputs from this model can then be filtered using non-maximum suppression. The performance of this model can then be quantified by computing the mean average precision across a set of 10 PR curves describing the quality of our model's predicted bounding boxes over a simulated datset consiting of 100 aimges which resemble micsocopy slides.
